# AdapterDesignPattern
This project implements the adapter design pattern. It represents a cassette tape
and a CD that can play music. The adapter converts a CD (Digital Album) to act as a 
cassette tape (Analog Album). This is done through the AnalogAdapter.
# Getting Started
To execute this program, run the `MusicDriver.java` class.
